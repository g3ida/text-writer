# text-writer
a  Python3 tool that writes automatically clipboard copied text when triggered by a keyboard shortcut. This project was created while I was preparing a technical training to the develeopers teams when I was working at Expensya. I used it to look as if I where typing code snippets by myself while presenting the demo. I knnow this looks very insane ðŸ™ˆ
